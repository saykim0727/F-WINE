The intention of the author and the invoker of this contract is to set the string to be stored for the user. \nIt should be called by the user to set the user's string or remove the user's string.  It will fail if called more than once per minute, except when the user buys a new character or when one of the user's characters is bought by another user.  The user's string is limited in what characters it can contain and the user's string is limited in its allowed length.  If the string is to be set empty, the user's existing string is only removed, not updated.\nIt shall have no other effect.\n\n### Term\nTERM.
